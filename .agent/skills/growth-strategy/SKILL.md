description: Governs Tenzu's "Connect for Free, Pay to Launch" growth model. Use when working on `SubscriptionGate`, free-tier routing, read-only dashboard access, date range limits, action gating (pause/edit/create), AI insight blurring, or any upsell trigger placement. Core principle — "Monitoring is Free, Action is Paid."

# Growth Strategy Skill — Free Dashboard ("Insight vs. Action")

## Core Philosophy

> **"We give you the Diagnosis for free, but you pay for the Cure."**

Users connect their Meta Ad Account for free and instantly see a beautiful read-only dashboard of their _existing_ campaigns. They upgrade when they need to **act** — pause a wasteful ad, create a new one, or unlock AI optimization.

This is the primary acquisition funnel. Tenzu is a **"Trojan Horse"** — let them into the fortress (the dashboard) for free, but lock the armory (the tools to fight).

## Why This Works in Nigeria

1. **Zero Friction Setup:** "Connect Facebook" is one button. No credit card.
2. **Instant Gratification:** Beautiful, fast stats — better than Facebook's clunky mobile app.
3. **Trust First:** They see we report accurate data _before_ giving us money.
4. **Pain-Driven Upgrade:** They don't upgrade because we "sold" them — they upgrade because they have a specific pain (wasting ₦) that the Pro tool solves instantly.
5. **Low Cost:** Fetching + displaying JSON from Meta API costs us almost nothing.

## The Three Friction Layers

### Layer 1: "Time Machine" Block (Data Limitation)

Business owners are obsessed with "What happened today?" but they _need_ "What happened last month?" to grow.

| Access            | Free Tier                     | Paid Tier (Starter+)               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Date range        | Last 7 days / This month only | Unlimited (lifetime, custom dates) |
| Period comparison | ❌ No "vs. Previous Period"   | ✅ Green/red arrows showing growth |
| Export            | ❌                            | ✅ CSV/PDF                         |

**Upsell UX:** The `DateRangePicker` component shows all dates, but selecting a date older than 30 days triggers a glassmorphism modal:

> _"See the Full Picture — Analyze seasonal trends with Lifetime History on Tenzu Pro."_

**Server enforcement:**

```typescript
// In server action: clamp startDate to 30-day window for free tier
if (tier === "free" && isBefore(startDate, subDays(new Date(), 30))) {
  return { error: "History limit reached", data: null, isUpgradeTrigger: true };
}
```

### Layer 2: "Panic Button" Block (Action Gating)

**Highest conversion trigger.** The user sees a campaign with high CPC — they are panicking because they're wasting money.

| Action                     | Free Tier             | Paid Tier         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| View campaign stats        | ✅                    | ✅                |
| Pause / Resume campaign    | ❌ (triggers paywall) | ✅                |
| Edit campaign targeting    | ❌ (triggers paywall) | ✅                |
| Create new campaign        | ❌ (triggers paywall) | ✅                |
| AI image / copy generation | ❌ (triggers paywall) | ✅ (credit-gated) |

**Upsell UX:** The "Pause" toggle, "Edit" button, and "New Campaign" CTA are all visible but trigger a paywall on click:

> _"Control your ad spend instantly from Tenzu. Upgrade to Pause, Edit, and Optimize in one click."_

**Why it converts:** They are emotionally invested in stopping the loss. The subscription cost (₦10,000/mo) is likely less than the money they're wasting on that bad ad.

### Layer 3: "Blurred Consultant" (AI Insights Tease)

Use the Bento Grid layout to tease AI analysis results.

| Element              | Free Tier                       | Paid Tier                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Optimization Score   | ✅ Visible: "Low (42/100)"      | ✅ Same                                                 |
| Diagnosis text       | 🔒 Blurred: `filter: blur(4px)` | ✅ Full text: "Your audience targeting is too broad..." |
| "Fix with AI" button | ❌ Disabled                     | ✅ Auto-applies the optimization                        |

**Upsell UX:** The blurred text is tantalizing — they can see _something intelligent_ was computed, but can't read it:

> _"Unlock AI-powered recommendations to save money and get more customers."_

## Key Rules

- **Never hide data with CSS alone.** All gates must be enforced server-side (server actions / RLS). Client blur is cosmetic only.
- **Never auto-downgrade to free.** Free is the entry state — once they subscribe, expiry goes to `expired` (which shows `SubscriptionGate` lock), not back to `free`.
- **"Free" is not "Expired."** Free users chose not to pay _yet_. Expired users _stopped_ paying. Different UX — free gets the read-only dashboard; expired gets the reactivation lock screen.
- **Sync existing campaigns on connect.** As soon as they connect their Meta account, trigger `syncCampaigns()` to populate the dashboard — this is the "Aha!" moment.
- **UI language:** "Start for free" not "Free trial." "Upgrade" not "Subscribe." "Unlock" not "Pay."
